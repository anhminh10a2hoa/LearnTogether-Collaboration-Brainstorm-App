# Lets Brainstorm

Brainstorm is an example of using the Fluid Framework to build a collaborative line of business application. In this example each user can create their own sticky notes that is managed on a board. Ideas that have been "liked" appear
in a list and are sorted based upon the number likes.

In addition, we're adding Azure Communication Services for interactive chat on the board.

## Set up Communication Services

### Create resources

1. [Create a Communication Services resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/communication-services/quickstarts/create-communication-resource?tabs=windows&pivots=platform-azp) in the Azure Portal and navigate to *Keys* to note down your *connection string* and *endpoint*.
1. [Create a Storage Account resource](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-account-create?tabs=azure-portal) in the Azure Portal and get your *connection string* under *Keys*.
1. In `src/azure/local.settings.json` set `AzureWebJobsStorage` to be your Storage Account connection string, `ResourceConnectionString` to be your Communication Services connection string, and `ResourceEndpoint` to be your Communication Services endpoint.
1. In `src/view/ChatPopUp.tsx` set `ENDPOINT` to be your Communication Services endpoint.

### Set up and run Azure Functions
We are using a minimal serverless backend for managing chat users and threads.
1. Install Azure Function Core Tools via `npm i -g azure-functions-core-tools`
1. If using VS Code, install the [Azure Functions extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-azurefunctions) for easy debugging and deployment.
1. Navigate to `src/azure` and run `npm install`
1. Run `npm run start` to run functions locally or deploy them with the Azure Functions extension.
1. In `src/Utils/api.ts` set `BASE_URL` to your functions url. This is the public url of your deployed functions app, or when running locally you can find it in your console logs, e.g. `http://localhost:7071/api`.

## Running the App Locally 

Follow the steps below to run this in local mode (Azure local service):

1. Run `npm install` from the brainstorm folder root
1. Run `npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest` to start the Azure local service for testing and development
1. Run `npm run start` to start the client
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser tab

üìù NOTE

Azure local service is a local, self-contained test service. Running `npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest` from your terminal window will launch the Azure local server. The server will need to be started first in order to provide the ordering and storage requirement of the Fluid runtime.

## Running the App Locally with Azure Relay Service as the Fluid Service

To run this follow the steps below:

1. Go to the Azure portal and search for `Fluid Relay`.
1. Create a new Azure Fluid Relay resource and note the `Tenant Id`, `Primary key`, and `Orderer Endpoint` and `Storage Endpoint` values.
1. Rename the `.env-template` file in the root of the project to `.env`.
1. Replace the values in the `.env` file with the appropriate values from the Azure portal.
1. Open a terminal window at the root of the project.
1. Run `npm install` from the root
1. Run `export REACT_APP_FLUID_CLIENT=useAzure` in the terminal to create an environment variable (if using PowerShell run `$env:REACT_APP_FLUID_CLIENT='useAzure'`). This will cause the app to use Fluid Relay service instead of `azure-local-service` for the Fluid relay service.
)
1. Run `npm start` to start the client
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser tab

## Using the Brainstorm App

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

    You'll be taken to a url similar to 'http://localhost:3000/**#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c**' the path `#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c` specifies one brainstorm document.

1. Create another chrome tab with `http://localhost:3000/**#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c**`

    Now you can create notes, write text, change colors and have a chat!
