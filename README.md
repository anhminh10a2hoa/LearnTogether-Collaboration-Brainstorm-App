# Lets Brainstorm

Brainstorm is an example of using the Fluid Framework to build a collaborative line of business application. In this example each user can create their own sticky notes that is managed on a board. Ideas that have been "liked" appear
in a list and are sorted based upon the number likes.

There are 3 branches available in this repo:

1. `main` - Fluid Framework application demo
1. `acs` - Fluid Framework and Azure Communication Services chat demo
1. `m365` - Fluid Framework, Microsoft Graph Toolkit, Microsoft 365, Event Hub, Azure Functions, SignalR demo

## Running the App Locally 

Follow the steps below to run this in local mode (Azure local service):

Run `npm install` from the brainstorm folder root
Run `npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest` to start the Azure local service for testing and development
Run `npm run start` to start the client
Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser tab

üìù NOTE

Azure local service is a local, self-contained test service. Running `npx @fluidframework/azure-local-service@latest` from your terminal window will launch the Azure local server. The server will need to be started first in order to provide the ordering and storage requirement of the Fluid runtime.

## Running the App Locally with Azure Relay Service as the Fluid Service

To run this follow the steps below:

1. Go to the Azure portal and search for `Fluid Relay`.
1. Create a new Azure Fluid Relay resource and note the `Tenant Id`, `Primary key`, and `Orderer Endpoint` and `Storage Endpoint` values.
1. Rename the `.env-template` file in the root of the project to `.env`.
1. Replace the values in the `.env` file with the appropriate values from the Azure portal.
1. Open a terminal window at the root of the project.
1. Run `npm install` from the root
1. Run `export REACT_APP_FLUID_CLIENT=useAzure` in the terminal to create an environment variable (if using PowerShell run `$env:REACT_APP_FLUID_CLIENT='useAzure'`). This will cause the app to use Fluid Relay service instead of `azure-local-service` for the Fluid relay service.
)
1. Run `npm start` to start the client
1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in a browser tab

## Using the Brainstorm App

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

    You'll be taken to a url similar to 'http://localhost:3000/**#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c**' the path `#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c` specifies one brainstorm document.

2. Create another chrome tab with `http://localhost:3000/**#a9c16d13-43fa-413a-859c-514e5bcaba3c**`

    Now you can create notes, write text, change colors and more!
